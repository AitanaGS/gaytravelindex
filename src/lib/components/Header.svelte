            In many countries, people face threats to their safety and well-being because of who 
            they love or how they identify. Each year, the Spartacus International Gay Guide 
            releases the Gay Travel Index (GTI). The index helps travelers by keeping track 
            of the rights of local LGBTQIA+ communities in each country, 
            ensuring they can travel safely. It also provides insight into the lives of people 
            in those countries and the social challenges they face.
