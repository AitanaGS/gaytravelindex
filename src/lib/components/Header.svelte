            In many countries, people face threats to their safety and well-being because 
            of who they love or how they identify. Each year, the Spartacus International 
            Gay Guide releases the Gay Travel Index (GTI).
            The index assists travelers by monitoring the rights and conditions of local LGBTQIA+ 
            communities in each country, ensuring their safety during travel.
            While its primary focus is on travel, it also offers insight into the lives of people 
            within these countries and the social challenges they face.
