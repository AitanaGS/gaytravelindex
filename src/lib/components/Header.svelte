        <p>
          In many countries, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people still have to fear 
          for their safety and happiness. Every year, the Spartacus International Gay Guide publishes 
          the Gay Travel Index (GTI). It monitors the status and rights of the local LGBTQ+ community 
          in each country and serves as a first guide to help tourists travel safely.
